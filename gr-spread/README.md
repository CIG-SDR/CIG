gr-spread
=======

This module implements some spread spectrum techniques for GNU Radio.
 
 * Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS)
 * Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)

In an attempt to make this project self-sustained, I avoid depending on
other projects and only depend on base GNU Radio functionality. 

Install
=======
Ensure you are in the source directory, and run the following commands:

    $ mkdir build 
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ../ && make test
    $ make install
